## Overview

To allow Cloudlvl to manage your AWS infrastructure, you need to provide secure access to your AWS account. There are two recommended methods:

<Note>
**IAM Roles (Recommended)**: More secure with temporary credentials and fine-grained permissions, but requires more setup steps.

**IAM User**: Simpler to set up with permanent access keys, but less secure for production environments.

</Note>

---

## Method 1: IAM Roles (Recommended)

IAM roles provide enhanced security by using temporary credentials and can be configured with precise permissions. This is the recommended approach for production environments.

### Step 1: Use External ID

1. Copy the generated **External ID** (this unique identifier ensures only Cloudlvl can assume your role)

### Step 2: Create IAM Role in AWS Console

1. Go to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles)
2. Click **"Create role"**
3. Select **"AWS account"** as the trusted entity type
4. Choose **"Another AWS account"**
5. Check **"Require external ID"** option
6. Paste the External ID from Step 1 and click **"Next"**

### Step 3: Configure Permissions

1. Select the permissions that Cloudlvl AI will need for your use case:
   - For full infrastructure management: `PowerUserAccess` or `AdministratorAccess`
   - For specific services: Choose relevant AWS managed policies (EC2, Lambda, S3, etc.)
2. Click **"Next"**

### Step 4: Finalize Role Creation

1. Enter a **Role name** (e.g., "CloudlvlAIRole")
2. Add a **Description** (e.g., "Role for Cloudlvl AI to manage AWS infrastructure")
3. Click **"Create role"**

### Step 5: Update Trust Policy

1. Find your newly created role in the roles list and click on it
2. Go to the **"Trust relationships"** tab
3. Return to the Cloudlvl app and copy the trust policy from the setup form

4. Back in AWS Console, click **"Edit trust policy"**
5. Replace the existing policy with the one from Cloudlvl
6. Click **"Update policy"**

### Step 6: Complete Setup in Cloudlvl

1. Return to the Cloudlvl app setup form
2. Enter your **Role ARN** (found in the role summary)
3. Click **"Submit"** to validate and complete the setup

<Tip>
  Your IAM role is now configured! Cloudlvl can securely assume this role to
  manage your AWS resources.
</Tip>

## Method 2: IAM User

IAM users provide direct access through access keys. This method is simpler but less secure than IAM roles.

<Warning>
  Access keys provide permanent access to your AWS account. Store them securely
  and rotate them regularly.
</Warning>

### Option A: Use Existing Access Keys

If you already have AWS access keys configured:

1. Use your existing **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
2. Ensure the associated user has the necessary permissions for Cloudlvl operations
3. Enter the credentials in the Cloudlvl setup form

### Option B: Create New IAM User

#### Step 1: Create IAM User

1. Go to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)
2. Click **"Create user"**
3. Enter a username (e.g., "cloudlvl-ai-user")
4. Select **"Programmatic access"**
5. Click **"Next"**

#### Step 2: Set Permissions

1. Choose how to assign permissions:
   - **Attach policies directly**: Select AWS managed policies
   - **Add user to group**: Create or use existing groups with appropriate policies
2. For full infrastructure management, consider:
   - `PowerUserAccess` (recommended for most use cases)
   - `AdministratorAccess` (full access, use with caution)
3. Click **"Next"** through the remaining steps
4. Click **"Create user"**

#### Step 3: Generate Access Keys

1. Click on your newly created user from the users list
2. Go to the **"Security credentials"** tab
3. Click **"Create access key"**

_[Screenshot placeholder: AWS user security credentials with highlighted "Create access key" button]_

4. Select **"Command Line Interface (CLI)"** as the use case
5. Check the confirmation checkbox acknowledging the security best practices
6. Click **"Next"** and then **"Create access key"**

#### Step 4: Copy Credentials

1. Copy both the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
2. Store them securely (you won't be able to see the secret key again)

_[Screenshot placeholder: AWS access key display screen with keys to copy]_

#### Step 5: Configure in Cloudlvl

1. Return to the Cloudlvl app setup form
2. Enter your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
3. Click **"Submit"** to validate and complete the setup

_[Screenshot placeholder: Cloudlvl app form with access key fields]_

<Tip>
  Your IAM user is now configured! Cloudlvl can use these credentials to manage
  your AWS resources.
